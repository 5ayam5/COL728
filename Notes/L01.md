1. Two or three days a week proposed
1. **CP is there**

# History
1. FORTRAN optimising compiler was polled to be one of the most influential inventions in a poll conducted in 2000
1. It was a trivial translator from FORTRAN to assembly + simple optimisations
1. Met with huge opposition :)
1. Hand written assembly is still faster than compiled code (opposition had some validity)
1. Compilers were not open-source initially and were sold around

# GCC and LLVM
1. GCC is GPL license - copy-left license
    i. Copy-left is left recursive license
    i. License is imported from the parent
    i. Type of license cannot be modified
1. LLVM was graduate student project in UIUC - Apache license

# Issues with Compilers (and Design)
1. GCC code base is increasing at the rate of 3000-4000 lines per year (double derivative $\geq$ 0)
1. LLVM also has a linear increase with a similar slope
1. Compiler design will be cumbersome and unattractive for new people

# Points of Concern
1. Time
1. Power
1. Energy (technically dependent on previous two)

# Setting the Stage
1. A program can be viewed as a function that takes an input and gives an output
1. Alternate *interpretation* is that a program can be *interpreted*

## Interpreter vs Compiler

### Interpreter
1. Interpreter is like a state machine which modifies the state of the data based on the instruction
    $$(source, input) \to output \equiv source \to (input \to output)$$
1. Interpreter *interprets* line by line

### Compiler
1. Compiler takes source program as input and gives the executable as output
    $$source \to (input \to output) \equiv source \to executable$$
1. Compiler compiles the entire code at once before making the executable
1. Hence compiler has a lot of scope for optimisation vs an interpreter
1. Compiler can also be viewed as specialised partial evaluator (where interpreter $==$ evaluator)
