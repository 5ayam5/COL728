# Why Study Compilers?
1. Moore's law is dying
    i. source to drain leakage
    i. limited gate material
    i. limited options for transistor material
1. PL abstractions are becoming higher level

## S/W Improvements Made to Counter Moore's Law Decline
1. Single core $\to$ multi-core
1. SIMD
1. Complex ISAs

## Early Adoption of Compilers
1. The first language + compiler was developed in 1950s by John Backus
1. Compilers saw tremendous adoption by 1958
