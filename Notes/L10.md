1. Assume NFA has a single start and accept state
1. $c =$ 2 states: 1 start, 1 accept; 1 edge with $c$
1. $\epsilon$ 2 states: 1 start, 1 accept; 1 edge with $c$
1. $A + B =$ create a new start state which has epsilon transitions to $A$ and $B$; similarly add $\epsilon$ transition from either's accept state to the globa accept state
1. $AB =$ insert new start state; add $\epsilon$ from $A$'s accept to $B$'s start
1. $A * =$ add $\epsilon$ transition from accept state to start state
